{% include JB/setup %}

Starting point: We needed a small and simple API added to a several year old rails 4.2 project. We already have some APIs in use in this project which use basic rails controllers, ActiveModel, and sometimes jbuilder. So quickest would be to just build the API as we did with all the others. Maybe even use newish rails 5 ActionController::API and use "json:api":http://jsonapi.org/ setting to have some kind of standardization. Up to now we never needed real documentation (beside the code) as we ourselves consumed the APIs. What seems a nice option for API-docus is to use the test cases to generate the documentation as does "rspec_api_documentation":https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation or what can be done by writing cucumber files (see for example "cucumber docs on relishapp":http://www.relishapp.com/cucumber/cucumber/docs/cli/dry-run ).

BUT: I heard a lightening talk at this years "wroc_love.rb":http://www.wrocloverb.com/ by "LeFnord":https://github.com/LeFnord on the "grape api gem":http://www.ruby-grape.org/ and his little baby "grape-swagger":https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape-swagger which provides beautiful API documentation out of the box.

As our new API is to be consumed by a third Party we do need some documentation this time. Also we have some time to spare and are looking for a long term solution to our API-needs. We therefor decided to try out grape which is a framework independend of rails and does seem to do quite a lot of stuff in a reasonable manner :)


h3. Our first grape endpoint

First of to find out what we need to include to use grape inside a rails project. There is a gem which wraps the varios best practices of integrating grape into rails ("grape_ape_rails":http://mepatterson.github.io/grape_ape_rails/ ) but it has not been maintained recently (last commit 2 years ago). Also it propably is better to add what is needed step by step to get to know the grape ecosystem. We therefor start of with adding

    gem 'grape'

which is version 0.18.0 in our case.

Next up we have a look at the README. Wow - pages over pages. A lot more than the usual rails gems which consist of a five steps and finish approach. A bit overwhelming at first, especially as one has to filter out what's necessary for a rails project.

We create our first API endpoint (i call it that, found no other fitting name) by placing a ruby file under app/api. We have to follow rails conventions for naming classes/modules (i.e. filenames + folders) but we do not need to create a v1 folder to version our API. Instead grape allows us to define the version (and what strategy to use e.g. path or header) inside our endpoint.

<pre>
class Nirvana < Grape::API
  version 'v1'
  format :json
  prefix :api

  resource :cities do
    desc 'Return ten cities matching the query'

    params do
      requires :q, type: String
    end
    get :all do
      City.search(params['q']).limit(10)
    end
  end

end
</pre>

For our first tryout we include a simple cities resource using a query param.

Next up a test (yea next time we'll write that one first ;) ). we create a test/api directory to bundle up everything api related. The test does not differ much from usual model tests although this is more like an rails controller test.

<pre>
require 'test_helper'

class NirvanaTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  include Rack::Test::Methods

  def app
    Rails.application
  end

  test 'GET /api/statuses/public_timeline returns an empty array of statuses' do
    get '/api/v1/nirvana/cities'
    assert last_response.ok?
    assert_equal [], JSON.parse(last_response.body)
  end

end
</pre>

We need the app method so rack-test knows what to use. I wonder if there will be a point at which it might be nice to have a stricter seperation of testing as in rails (models, controllers, integration). Although an API of course is diffent.

First test run of course fails. We have not yet mounted the API nor loaded the app/api directory. Unfortunately test is still red. Now comes the hard part. How do we debug Grape inside of rails? First guess is to validate we actually are using the right route. Unfortunately our handy 'rake routes' does not help with this. We therefor inspect 'Nirvana.routes' on the console.

<pre>
 > Nirvana.routes.map{|route| route.pattern.path}
 => ["/api/:version/cities/all(.json)"] 
 </pre>

Okay, so the route consists of api-prefix + version + resource + action. I wonder if this is fixed or other parts may be inserted. It should be easier to print out grape routes than it is today. I tried out the "grape-rails-routes":https://github.com/pmq20/grape-rails-routes gem but it does not seem to work with recent grape versions. Better luck with "grape-raketasks":https://github.com/reprah/grape-raketasks which works although the printout could be a bit more compact:

<pre>
$ rake grape_raketasks:routes
ANCHOR:          true
API:             Nirvana
DESCRIPTION:     "Return ten cities matching the query"
FORWARD_MATCH:   nil
METHOD:          "GET"
NAMESPACE:       "/cities"
PARAMS:          {"q"=>{:required=>true, :type=>"String"}}
PREFIX:          :api
REQUIREMENTS:    {}
SETTINGS:        {:description=>{:description=>"Return ten cities matching the query", :params=>{"q"=>{:required=>true, :type=>"String"}}}, :declared_params=>[:q]}
SUFFIX:          "(.json)"
VERSION:         "v1"
</pre>

And thats for only one single endpoint - good luck with a real API.


h3. And now the documentation

Next up we want to generate some beautiful documentation for our API. For this we wil be using the grape-swagger gem which generates the docs. As we want to directly include them in our rails project we start off with the "grape-swagger-rails":https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape-swagger-rails gem which allows us to mount the swagger UI as an engine. So off we go, follow the README, add gem, create initializer and open the swagger UI...

!{width: 100%}{{ site.url }}/assets/images/grape/grape-swagger-rails-ui-cant-read.png(Swagger UI is not working yet)!

Hmm... only kinda works :) We had to specify an url and app_url in an initializer. The example url was just a path to a json file. I guess it's supposed to be the 'Swagger API schema'. Question is how to generate this. Seems as if swagger itself is not included in the grape-swagger-rails gem which in my opinion does not make sense or at least is not what one would expect from a rails gem. 

So let's install "grape-swagger":https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape-swagger and set it up. We follow the README and create a root node:
<pre>
require 'grape-swagger'

class Root < Grape::API
  mount Nirvana
  add_swagger_documentation
end
</pre>
But the suggested path 'localhost:3000/swagger_doc' does not work for us. We just end up with an 404 from our rails app. Our rake grape routes gem also gives no hint as to which path to use. So after trying out a whole lot of different routes (for instance 'localhost:3000/api/v1/swagger_doc') we still do not know how to actually generate the swagger schema. Then lightening struck - the example given by grape-swagger mounts a couple of other endpoints. I thought this was only due to whats supposed to be included in the docs but then i realized the Root node is the one which should be mounted inside routes.rb. Only then the swagger_doc is accessible. For now the easiest is to simply include the 'add_swagger_documentation' into our initial cities endpoint. Five seconds later after changing the schema url to 'api/v1/swagger_doc':

!{{ site.url }}/assets/images/grape/grape-swagger-ui-working.png(Yeah)!

Nice! A usable and intuitive documentation for our API. Some polishing still has to be done (for instance where will we set 'API title'?) and some details are still puzzeling (i.e. why is there a 0.0.1 version shown in the footer when we specified v1 as our API version?). But all in all it's great :)

.h3 Conclusion

So all in all we have a nice API with great documentation generated for us. On the downside it is a pitty many of our trusted rails tools do not work and/or have to be reinvented. We will see how much overhead this adds to further developing the API and adding more advanced features such as authentication, caching or using JSON:API as format.
